## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Development Server Connection

If you're having trouble connecting to the development server:

1. Make sure Metro bundler is running (`npx expo start --dev-client`)
2. For iOS: If using tunnel mode, you may need to rebuild the app after Info.plist changes
3. Check that your device and computer are on the same network (for LAN mode)
4. Clear cache and restart: `npx expo start --dev-client --clear`

### Calendar Sync Issues

- Ensure calendar permissions are granted
- The app automatically selects a writable calendar
- If you have only read-only calendars, the app will create a new writable calendar

### Date/Time Picker Issues

- Date and time pickers use modals that appear above the keyboard
- If a picker seems hidden, try dismissing the keyboard first
- The pickers work best with a development build
